# KSP-Personal-Rescue-Enclosure
A KSP mod adding the Personal Rescue Enclosure to the game.
# What?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Rescue_Enclosure <br />
The Personal Rescue Enclosure was essentially a space-grade beachball that an astronaut could cram themselves into if there weren't enough space suits.
Uses of it include:
- Carrying one crew member who doesn't need to control the vessel but does need to be in a cheap, small, and light "cabin"
- Ejecting annoying tourist Kerbals (since they can't EVA) and maybe picking them back up again with a claw
- Space soccer </p>
To EVA or move kerbals into it you'll need to right click -> transfer kerbal since there is no IVA model (how would you even make one for a space this small?)
# Features
- Can be stored in cargo modules and placed by Engineers
- Has a light and dark variant
- Label showing which side is the entrance
# Why isn't this on Curseforge?
Curse seems to need a twitch account and twitch is owned by Amazon. Ew. If you want to reupload it there go ahead so long as you link back to here somewhere.
